            recognizes natively but Raven has no ProviderSpec for, e.g.
            nebius/fireworks/together) -- there is nothing to compare against;
          - the resolved spec is OAuth-based (e.g. github_copilot): one OAuth
            grant can serve several upstream vendors, so a spec mismatch there
            says nothing about whether this instance can serve the model;
          - the model resolves to no spec at all (custom endpoints, bare ids
            only LiteLLM itself recognizes).
        In all of those, the model is not known to be wrong for this
        instance, so it fails loudly at the wire instead of being guessed
        away here.

        which the spec-based guess below is wrong -- a per-model routing
        endpoint is built with ``provider_name="custom"`` for its api_base /
        api_key shape alone, not because the backend behind it is known to be a
        self-hosted inference server, so ``custom`` there would falsely claim
        every one of its responses.

        the large hosted vendors below it, so a bare ``</think>`` in content

        normalization exists for. When nothing was auto-detected, fall back to
        whatever spec ``provider_name`` resolves to.

        An identity that resolves to nothing answers False, the same reading
        ``can_serve`` settled on: an unresolved name says nothing about the
        backend, and several production constructors (the proactive planner,
        the evolver) build direct big-vendor connections with no

        genuinely self-hosted backend is reached through ``custom`` or a
        local spec, which is where the parser-less sglang/vLLM shape comes
        from; a resolved direct big vendor (anthropic, openai, ...) never
        produces it behind its own API.
